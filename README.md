# Character-Sheet
(WIP)
Full stack application that generates D&D character sheet data then saves/loads to/from a database while displaying on a web page that maintains updated stats and handles events like level up, simulated dice roll, and inventory management.
Created using visual studio 2019, visual studio code, and ms sql server.

### Implemented
* backend model(enough to test basic functionality)
* menu interface for demonstrating implemented sections in console.

### To-Do List
* automated testing
* build database in SQL
* reorganize existing classes and implement controllers/DAOs
* create frontend web page using vue.js
* add additional races/classes/stats when overall application is implemented & working correctly
